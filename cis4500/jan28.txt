useful sql features
- expressions: do computation over scalars (int, real, string) in SELECT or WHERE
- strings: comparison operators(=, <,>,<>,...), use single quotes, special comparision operator: LIKE (e.g. '%Smith' where % is a wild card)
- ordering: ascending unless you specifiy DESC, ties broekn by the second attribute in the ORDER BY list, etc. (lexicographical ordering)

summary
- SELECT [DISTINCT] {list of attributes}
- FROM {list of tables}
- 

Meaning (semantics) of SQL Queries
- SQL queries
SELECT a_1,a_2,...,a_k
FROM R_1,R_2,...,R_n
WHERE conditions

- nested loops
Answer = {}
for x_1 in R_1
    for x_2 in R_2
    ...
    for x_n in R_n do
        if conditions
            then Answer = Answer U {(a_1,...,a_k}
return Answer

- unintuitive SQLism -> corss product with empty set 

- operators: union, intersect, minus remove duplicates unless ALL is used 

- complex SQL queries:
1. subqueries:IN/NOT IN, ALL/ANY
2. subqueries:EXISTS, NOT EXISTS

subqueries:
- a query can occur in the WHERE clause of a query 
- uncorrelated: independent of outer query

find all sids in cids where there is an sid=1 (can be done with a CTE or a temporary table)
SELECT sid
FROM Takes
WHERE cid IN
    (SELECT sid
     FROM Takes
     WHERE sid=1)

- correlated: refers to variable in the outer query

IN/NOT IN
- {attr} IN {subquery}: "students who have taken a course that was taught at some point by prof. marcus"
- {attr} NOT IN {subquery}: "students who have taken a course that has never been taught by prof marcus"

ALL/ANY
- {attr}{op} ALL {subqeury} - universaly quantification: "find students who are expecting the highest grade"
- {attr}{op} ANY {subquery} - existential quantification: "find students who are not expecting the lowest grade"
